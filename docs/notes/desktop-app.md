# Desktop Application

## Application

You can download the application at `https://dl.discordapp.net/apps/linux/<version>/discord-<version>.tar.gz`.  
As of January 1, 2023, the version is 0.0.22 (released on December 10, 2022).  
As of September 28, 2023, the version is 0.0.30 (released on September 19, 2023).  


Builds for other platforms follow a different versioning scheme, so I recommend using the Linux version as the base.  

Examples as of September 28, 2023:  
* `https://dl.discordapp.net/distro/app/stable/win/x86/1.0.9018/DiscordSetup.exe`  
* `https://dl.discordapp.net/apps/osx/0.0.278/Discord.dmg`  

You can use the [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://discord.com/download) to access old version codes.  

The `app.asar` in the Linux archive can be used for all platforms, but you need to gather the Electron runtime for your target platform.  

## Native Modules

You can download the modules at `https://dl.discordapp.net/apps/linux/<version>/modules/<module name>-<module version>.zip`.
