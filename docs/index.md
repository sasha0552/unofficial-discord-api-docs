# Introduction

Some Discord API documentation from the reverse engineered Discord client build as of 2023-01-01 (Stable 165485)

My goal is build fully discord-compatible backend (because I can't do frontend), to use as my own messenger.  

If you want to help me in the reverse engeenering, I can give you an entire client build (I wrote some tools for downloading discord client from discord.com, so client can be used completely offline), and access to backend API for testing.  
Also, if you have any questions about discord client/backend, you can also contact me. And I'll try to answer.  

You can contact me in Discord:  
My username#discriminator: `sasha0552#5178`.  
Also, I created [guild](https://discord.gg/SX8dvXuTfR) for this.
